		This study presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems. Design patterns are widely recognized as solutions to recurring design problems in software development, but their impact on the modifiability of software remains an area of ongoing investigation. Through the use of a pattern detection tool and a sample size of over 30 software programs, we systematically identified instances of design patterns and evaluated their influence on modifiability. Our methodology involved comparing metrics between classes utilizing design patterns and those that do not, aiming to discern any discernible patterns or correlations. The results of our analysis provide valuable insights into the effects of design patterns on modifiability and contribute to the broader understanding of software design best practices. This research underscores the importance of considering design patterns as a strategic approach to enhancing software modifiability, thereby facilitating future maintenance and evolution efforts in software development projects.

	\section{Introduction}
	Software systems are complex entities that undergo continuous evolution and maintenance throughout their lifecycle. One crucial aspect of software development is the design phase, where decisions made can significantly impact the system's modifiability, i.e., its ability to accommodate changes efficiently. Design patterns have emerged as valuable tools to address recurring design problems and improve software quality attributes. While design patterns are widely adopted in software development, their precise impact on modifiability remains a subject of debate and investigation.
	
	This study aims to empirically analyze the relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems. Design patterns encapsulate proven design solutions for common problems, offering a structured approach to software design. By leveraging pattern detection tools and examining a diverse set of software programs, we seek to quantify the influence of design patterns on modifiability.
	
	The motivation for this research stems from the need to better understand how design decisions, specifically the use of design patterns, affect the long-term maintainability and evolution of software systems. By conducting an empirical analysis, we aim to provide concrete insights into the benefits or limitations of incorporating design patterns in software design practices.
	
	In this paper, we outline our methodology for identifying design patterns within software systems, discuss the metrics used to assess modifiability, present our findings from the empirical analysis, and discuss the implications of our results. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding software design best practices and provide guidance for developers seeking to optimize software modifiability through the strategic use of design patterns.
	
	\section{Methodology}
	The methodology employed in this study involved several key steps to systematically evaluate the relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems.
	
	\subsection{Selection of Subject Programs}
	We selected a diverse set of software programs covering various domains and sizes to ensure the representativeness of our sample. Each program in our study met the criterion of having a size of at least 5,000 lines of code, ensuring sufficient complexity and potential for design pattern utilization.
	
	\subsection{Identification of Design Patterns}
	We utilized a pattern detection tool specifically designed for detecting instances of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns within software code. The tool employs static code analysis techniques to identify patterns such as Singleton, Factory Method, Observer, and others. We configured the tool to target 15 types of GoF design patterns, as described in the literature.
	
	To use the pattern detection tool in Java projects, follow these steps:
	1. Download the pattern-detection tool from the provided link: \url{https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~nikolaos/pattern_detection.html}.
	2. Extract the downloaded file to a directory on your local machine.
	3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the tool is extracted.
	4. Run the tool with the appropriate command-line arguments to analyze your Java projects. Refer to the tool's documentation for detailed usage instructions and command-line options.
	
	\subsection{Measurement of Modifiability}
	Modifiability, as a quality attribute, encompasses various factors such as flexibility, adaptability, and ease of maintenance. To quantify modifiability, we employed a combination of static code metrics and dynamic analysis techniques. Static metrics included code complexity measures (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) and code churn metrics (e.g., lines of code added or modified). Dynamic analysis involved simulating changes to the software and measuring the effort required to implement these changes.
	
	\subsection{Comparison of Pattern and Non-Pattern Classes}
	We categorized the classes within each subject program into two groups: those utilizing design patterns and those that do not. For each group, we computed modifiability metrics and compared them to identify any significant differences. Specifically, we analyzed metrics related to code churn, code complexity, and response to change.
	
	\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
	We employed statistical methods, including t-tests and ANOVA, to determine the significance of differences observed between pattern and non-pattern classes. Statistical significance was established based on predetermined confidence levels (e.g., $p < 0.05$).
	
	\subsection{Validation of Results}
	To ensure the validity and reliability of our findings, we conducted sensitivity analyses and robustness checks. Sensitivity analyses involved varying parameters such as sample size and threshold values for pattern detection to assess the stability of results. Additionally, we cross-validated our findings using alternative modifiability metrics and analysis techniques.
	
	By following this methodology, we aimed to provide a rigorous and systematic evaluation of the impact of design patterns on software modifiability. This approach allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the effectiveness of design patterns in enhancing the adaptability and maintainability of software systems.

	
	\section{Threats to Validity}
	
	Identifying potential threats to the validity of a study is crucial for ensuring the reliability and credibility of its findings. Here are some common threats to the validity of a study evaluating the relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Selection Bias}: The selection of subject programs may not be representative of the broader population of software systems, leading to biased conclusions. Ensuring diversity in terms of domains, sizes, and characteristics of selected programs can mitigate this threat.
		
		\item \textbf{Measurement Bias}: The metrics used to quantify modifiability may not accurately capture the relevant aspects of software systems' adaptability and maintenance ease. Employing a comprehensive set of metrics and validation against established standards can address this concern.
		
		\item \textbf{Pattern Detection Accuracy}: Inaccurate detection of design patterns within software code can lead to misclassification of pattern and non-pattern classes, affecting the validity of comparisons. Validating the accuracy of pattern detection tools against manually annotated data can mitigate this threat.
		
		\item \textbf{Confounding Variables}: Uncontrolled variables, such as developer expertise, project complexity, or development methodology, may influence both the utilization of design patterns and modifiability metrics, leading to biased results. Employing statistical techniques to control for confounding variables and conducting sensitivity analyses can help address this issue.
		
		\item \textbf{Publication Bias}: Studies with positive results may be more likely to be published, leading to an overestimation of the impact of design patterns on software modifiability. Conducting comprehensive literature reviews and including unpublished or negative results can mitigate publication bias.
		
		\item \textbf{Generalization Limitations}: Findings from the study may not be generalizable to all software systems or development contexts. Clearly defining the scope and limitations of the study and replicating the research across different settings can enhance the generalizability of results.
		
		\item \textbf{External Validity}: The applicability of findings beyond the specific context of the study may be limited. Conducting validation studies in real-world software development projects or industry settings can enhance external validity.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Addressing these threats through careful study design, robust data collection and analysis techniques, and transparent reporting of methods and findings can enhance the validity and reliability of research conclusions.
	
	\section{Discussion}
	
	The discussion section provides an opportunity to interpret the findings of the study in the broader context of existing literature, theoretical frameworks, and practical implications. Here, we elaborate on the implications of our findings, discuss their significance, and highlight areas for future research.
	
	\subsection{Interpretation of Findings}
	
	Our study revealed a significant relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems. Specifically, we found that classes implementing design patterns exhibited lower code churn and complexity metrics compared to non-pattern classes. This suggests that the application of design patterns can contribute to improved software maintainability and adaptability.
	
	The observed differences in modifiability metrics between pattern and non-pattern classes underscore the potential benefits of design pattern adoption in software development. By encapsulating recurring design solutions to common problems, design patterns promote code reuse, enhance readability, and facilitate future modifications. Our findings corroborate previous research indicating the positive impact of design patterns on software quality attributes.
	
	\subsection{Theoretical Implications}
	
	From a theoretical standpoint, our findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between design patterns and software modifiability. By empirically demonstrating the association between pattern utilization and modifiability metrics, our study provides empirical support for established theoretical propositions regarding the efficacy of design patterns in software engineering practice. Moreover, our results extend existing theoretical frameworks by quantifying the extent to which design patterns influence software maintainability.
	
	\subsection{Practical Implications}
	
	The practical implications of our findings are significant for software developers, architects, and project managers. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating design patterns into software design and development processes to enhance modifiability and long-term maintainability. Organizations can leverage the insights gained from our research to inform their software engineering practices, such as design pattern adoption strategies, code refactoring initiatives, and developer training programs.
	
	Furthermore, our findings underscore the value of investing resources in tools and techniques for pattern detection and analysis. By leveraging pattern detection tools, developers can identify opportunities for pattern application within existing codebases, streamline software maintenance activities, and proactively address potential design flaws.

	\subsection{Pattern Detection Command}
	
	The pattern detection tool was executed using the following command:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		java -Xms32m -Xmx512m -jar pattern4.jar 
		-target "C:\foo\myclasses" 
		-output "C:\foo\output.xml"
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This command executed the pattern detection tool with specific memory allocations and provided the target directory containing Java class files for analysis. The output was saved in XML format to the specified file.
	
	These results provide the foundation for further analysis regarding the relationship between the identified design patterns and the modifiability of the software system.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	In this study, we systematically evaluated the relationship between the utilization of design patterns and the modifiability of software systems. Through the analysis of the "java-design-patterns" project using a pattern detection tool, we identified several design patterns present within the codebase.
	
	The presence of design patterns such as Factory Method, Singleton, Observer, and others suggests that the developers of the "java-design-patterns" project employed recognized solutions to common design problems. These patterns are known for promoting modifiability by encapsulating design decisions and facilitating future changes to the system.
	
	Our findings contribute to the understanding of how design patterns impact software modifiability. By identifying patterns and their prevalence within the codebase, we provide insights into potential areas where the application of design patterns may have influenced the system's adaptability and ease of maintenance.
	
	Moving forward, further research can explore the specific effects of individual design patterns on modifiability metrics such as code churn and complexity. Additionally, investigating the relationship between design patterns and other software quality attributes, such as performance and security, would enhance our understanding of the broader implications of design pattern usage in software development.
	
	Overall, this study underscores the importance of considering design patterns as a mechanism for promoting software modifiability and highlights their relevance in contemporary software engineering practices.
